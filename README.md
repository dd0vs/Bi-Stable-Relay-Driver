# Bi-Stable-Relay-Driver
An ATINY based driver for bi-stable relays (spdt-switches), e.g. 2SE1T11JB from Ducommun Technologies.

For Microwave transverters a RX/TX-relay is essential. There are a lot of spdt-switch-type relays available with a performance up to 24GHz. For such relays a driver with a ATINY85 as base was designed. The program flashed to ATINY85 is shown here. Programming and flashing was done with ATMEL Studio 7.0 and with great help of DL8DTL.
